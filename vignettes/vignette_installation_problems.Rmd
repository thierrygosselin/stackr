## Problems during installation
  
Sometimes you'll get warnings while installing dependencies required for **stackr** or other R packages.
```r
Warning: cannot remove prior installation of package ‘stringi’
```

To solve this problem, delete manually the problematic package in the installation folder (on mac: `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library`) or in the `Terminal`:
```r
sudo rm -R /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/package_name
# Changing 'package_name' to the problematic package.
# Reinstall the package.
```
