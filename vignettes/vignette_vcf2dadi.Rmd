# Objectives:
* learn how to run the function `stackr::vcf2dadi`

# Workflow

## Prepare your R workspace
1. Clean your desk and remove the clutter in the global environment
```r
rm(list=ls())
```

1. Load the required libraries
```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
if (!require("reshape2")) install.packages("reshape2")
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require("stringr")) install.packages("stringr")
if (!require("stringi")) install.packages("stringi")
if (!require("plyr")) install.packages("plyr")
if (!require("dplyr")) install.packages("dplyr")
if (!require("tidyr")) install.packages("tidyr")
if (!require("readr")) install.packages("readr")
if (!require("purrr")) install.packages("purrr")
if (!require("data.table")) install.packages("data.table")
if (!require("httr")) install.packages("httr")
library("httr")
if (!require("stackr")) install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr")
library("stackr")
```
1. Set your working directory
```
setwd("~/Documents/vcf2dadi_example")
```

## Get the data and create a strata file
1. Dataset: in this example, we use the data in Ferchaud and Hansen (2015 and 2016) 
paper.
```r
# download the file:
writeBin(
  httr::content(
    httr::GET(
      "http://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.97237/sticklebacks_Danish.vcf?sequence=1"
    ), "raw"), "example_vcf2dadi_ferchaud_2015.vcf"
)
```
## 
1. We need to generate a strata file necessary to make the vcf population-wise. 
The strata file is a tab-delimited file or object, in the global environment,
with 2 columns: `INDIVIDUALS` and `STRATA`. 
The `STRATA` column can be any hierarchical grouping.
  * Because the population id is contained in the name of the individuals and
  easily extracted with string command, we use the 
  function `stackr::individuals2strata`. 
  
    ```r
    # here is one individual id: 
    Hadsten10_q_75.align
    # with pop starting at position 1 and to keep only 3 characters (necessary to discriminate populations from each other) we stop at... 3
    ```
  
  * For info on the function use: `?individuals2strata`.
  Don't have this kind of names... you can also make the strata file by hand, 
  the old fashion way.

  * For your data, you might not need to make a strata file if you have already
  run \href{http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/}{stacks} on your data, 
the strata file is similar to a stacks `population map file`, make sure you 
have the required column names  (`INDIVIDUALS` and `STRATA`). 

  * We will extract the id from the first line of the vcf file. 
  If the individuals were in a single column in a file (e.g. "individuals.txt"), 
  make sure the column is named `INDIVIDUALS` and use the file directly 
  in the function `stackr::individuals2strata`.
  
  * We could put all the lines below in one call, but for clarity I'll break down
the steps:
```r
# Isolate the first line
id.vcf <- data.table::fread(
  input = "example_vcf2dadi_ferchaud_2015.vcf",
  sep = "\t",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE, 
  header = TRUE,
  # Automatically filter with blacklist of id
  drop = c("POS", "ID", "REF", "ALT", "QUAL", "FILTER", "INFO", "FORMAT"),
  skip = "CHROM",
  nrows = 1,
  showProgress = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE
) %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>% 
  select(-`#CHROM`)
  # to keep only the column name
  individuals <- data.frame(INDIVIDUALS = colnames(id.vcf)) 
```
```r
# create the strata
strata.stickleback <- stackr::individuals2strata(
data = individuals, 
strata.start = 1,
strata.end = 3,
filename = "strata.stickleback.tsv"
)
```

## Generate ∂a∂i input file
1. First run of `stackr::vcf2dadi`, without imputation. 
The simplest expression, with 2 arguments:
```r
stackr::vcf2dadi(
data = "example_vcf2dadi_ferchaud_2015.vcf", 
strata = "strata.stickleback.tsv"
)
# or strata = strata.stickleback 
# if the strata argument is an object in the global environment named 
# `strata.stickleback`
```

    72 sec later, this is what I get in my RStudio console:
    ```r

    ```
1. Since I didn't redirect the function call in an object 
(next example will show you how) the ∂a∂i input data is not in the global 
environment, it's only written to the working directory.


## Filtering the dataset before generating the ∂a∂i input file

1. It makes no sense to create a ∂a∂i input file with so many populations. If we
want to keep just 3 populations: Had, Mos and Odd, we use the `pop.select` 
argument.
This is where the default argument `common.markers = TRUE` becomes useful. It can be turned off with `FALSE`, 
however this is not something I recommend since you should only use SNPs WITHOUT missing data.

    For the second 
run of `stackr::vcf2dadi`, this time we also ask to generate a ∂a∂i input file with:
    * short range LD pruning: the small reads of this experiment
(RADseq < 100 pb read) make the short range linkage disequillibrium pruning easy.
We will keep the first SNP on every read. 
    * Minor Allele Frequency filter: for ∂a∂i we want to keep most of the 
Allele Frequency Spectrum, so we are filtering differently than for population 
assignment. Here we want to make sure we don't include the SNP with very 
very low frequency, the uninformative markers. So we ask to remove markers if the 
MAF is not at least 0.001 local (by pop) OR 0.001 global (overall pops) in a 
least 1 population (out of 3 the toal selected). For further details on how 
to remove low polymorphism markers with arguments provided in `vcf2dadi`, 
see the maf arguments documentation of the function.
    * imputations using random forest with default settings (see function arguments
documentation for more details)
    * the parallel process used by default will be all my CPU - 1.
```r
# The function results are redirected in the object `dadi.df`
dadi.df <- stackr::vcf2dadi(
  data = "example_vcf2dadi_ferchaud_2015.vcf", 
  strata = strata.stickleback, 
  pop.select = c("Had", "Mos", "Odd"),
  snp.ld = "first", 
  maf.thresholds = c(0.001, 0.001), 
  maf.pop.num.threshold = 1, maf.approach = "SNP", maf.operator = "OR", 
  imputation.method = "rf",
  #here I specify a custom output filename
  dadi.input.filename = "my.first.dadi.input.file.tsv"
)
```
    60 sec later, this is what I get in my RStudio console:
    ```r

    ```

1. To view the content of `dadi.df`:
```r
names(dadi.df)
```

1. To redirect both data frame in separate object, outside the list:
```r
dadi.no.imputation.df <- dadi.df$dadi.no.imputation
dadi.imputed.df <- dadi.df$dadi.imputed
```

1. The first few line of the ∂a∂i non imputed file,
written to the working directory:

    `#∂a∂i SNP input file generated with stackr v.0.2.9 2016-06-01 23:20:32`

   | IN_GROUP | OUT_GROUP | Allele1 | Had | Mos | Odd | Allele2 | Had | Mos | Odd |        MARKERS        |
|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---------------------:|
|   ---    |    ---    |    T    | 38  | 40  | 39  |    G    |  0  |  0  |  1  | groupI_28140_10711516 |
|   ---    |    ---    |    C    | 36  | 32  | 36  |    T    |  0  |  0  |  2  | groupI_28156_12157165 |
|   ---    |    ---    |    A    | 38  | 40  | 39  |    G    |  0  |  0  |  1  | groupI_28157_12211985 |
|   ...    |    ...    |   ...   | ... | ... | ... |   ...   | ... | ... | ... |          ...          |

  We see that the first 2 columns are empty. This is because we didn't specify 
  the outgroup. With this type of input file, ∂a∂i generates a folded spectrum.

## Using an outgroup and generate the ∂a∂i input file

To generate a ∂a∂i input file with an outgroup, we currently need stacks output
files in order to get the fasta and SNP position. 
Very soon I'll make an update where you can feed the function a file
containing all this info, making the function truly stacks-free. For those of
you using stacks you can do this to generate the file:
```r
## Do not run ##
# the dataset doesn't include outgroup info.
stackr::vcf2dadi(
  data = "example_vcf2dadi_ferchaud_2015.vcf", 
  strata = strata.stickleback, 
  pop.select = c("Had", "Mos", "Odd"),
  snp.ld = "first", 
  maf.thresholds = c(0.001, 0.001), 
  maf.pop.num.threshold = 1, maf.approach = "SNP", maf.operator = "OR", 
  imputation.method = "rf",
  fasta.ingroup = "batch_1.ingroup.fa",
  fasta.outgroup = "batch_1.outgroup.fa", 
  sumstats.ingroup = "batch_1.sumstats.ingroup.tsv",
  sumstats.outgroup = "batch_1.sumstats.outgroup.tsv"
)
```
