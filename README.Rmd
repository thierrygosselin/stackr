# stackr: an R package for the analysis of GBS/RADseq data

This is the development page of the **stackr**, 
if you want to help, see [contributions section](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr#contributions)

This new version of `stackr` refocus the package on running [stacks](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) sofware inside R. More on this very soon.

The function for filtering, manipulating and visualizing RADseq data are now hosted in a new package:
[radiator](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/radiator). Check it out!.



## Installation
To try out the dev version of **stackr**, copy/paste the code below:

```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools") # to install
devtools::install_github("thierrygosselin/stackr")
library(stackr)
```





## Prerequisite - Suggestions - Troubleshooting
  * **Parallel computing**: Follow the steps in this [vignette](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_imputations_parallel.Rmd)  to install [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) and [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) packages (e.g. to do imputations in parallel).
  * **Installation problem:** see this
  [vignette](https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_installation_problems.Rmd)
  * **Windows users**: Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
  * For a better experience in **stackr** and in R in general, I recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 
  The R GUI is unstable with functions using parallel ([more info](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/html/mclapply.html)).

## Roadmap of future developments:

* Workflow tutorial that links functions and points to specific vignettes to further explore some problems: *in progress*
* Integration of several functions with [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) database *in progress*.
* Use Shiny.
* Until publication **stackr** will change rapidly, stay updated with releases and contribute with bug reports.
* Suggestions ?


## Contributions:

This package has been developed in the open, and it wouldn’t be nearly as good without your contributions. There are a number of ways you can help me make this package even better:

* If you don’t understand something, please let me know. 
* Your feedback on what is confusing or hard to understand is valuable. 
* If you spot a typo, feel free to edit the underlying page and send a pull request.

New to pull request on github ? The process is very easy:

* Click the edit this page on the sidebar.
* Make the changes using github’s in-page editor and save.
* Submit a pull request and include a brief description of your changes. 
* “Fixing typos” is perfectly adequate.


## GBS workflow
The **stackr** package fits currently at the end of the GBS workflow. Below, a flow chart using [STACKS](http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/) and other software.
