\arguments{
\item{P}{path to the directory containing STACKS files.
Default: \code{P = "06_ustacks_2_gstacks"}.
Inside the folder \code{06_ustacks_2_gstacks}, you should have:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{4 files for each samples:} The sample name is the prefix of
  the files ending with:
\code{.alleles.tsv.gz, .models.tsv.gz, .snps.tsv.gz, .tags.tsv.gz}.
Those files are created in the
\href{http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/comp/ustacks.php}{ustacks}
module.
}}

\item{o}{Output path to write catalog.
Default: \code{o = "06_ustacks_2_gstacks"}}

\item{M}{path to a population map file (Required when P is used).
Default: \code{M = "02_project_info/population.map.catalog.tsv"}.}

\item{catalog.path}{This is for the "Catalog editing" part in cstacks where
you can provide the path to an existing catalog.
cstacks will add data to this existing catalog.
With default: \code{catalog.path = NULL} or with a supplied path, the function
The function scan automatically for the presence of a catalog inside the input folder.
If none is found, a new catalog is created.
If your catalog is not in the input folder, supply a path here.
e.g. \code{catalog.path = ~/catalog_folder}, the catalog files are inside the
P folder along the samples files and detected automatically.
If a catalog is detected in the input folder,
the samples in the \code{sample.list} argument
will be added in this catalog. The catalog is made of 3 files:
\code{catalog.alleles.tsv.gz, catalog.snps.tsv.gz, catalog.tags.tsv.gz}}

\item{n}{number of mismatches allowed between sample loci when build the catalog.
Default: \code{n = 1}}

\item{parallel.core}{Enable parallel execution with num_threads threads.
Default: \code{parallel.core = parallel::detectCores() - 1}}

\item{max.gaps}{The number of gaps allowed between stacks before merging.
Default: \code{max.gaps = 2}}

\item{min.aln.len}{The minimum length of aligned sequence in a gapped
alignment.
Default: \code{min.aln.len = 0.8}}

\item{disable.gapped}{Disable gapped alignments between stacks.
Default: \code{disable.gapped = FALSE} (use gapped alignments).}

\item{k.len}{Specify k-mer size for matching between between catalog loci
(automatically calculated by default).
Advice: don't modify.
Default: \code{k.len = NULL}}

\item{report.mmatches}{Report query loci that match more than one catalog locus.
Advice: don't modify.
Default: \code{report.mmatches = FALSE}}

\item{split.catalog}{(integer) In how many samples you want to split the
catalog population map. This allows to have a backup catalog every
\code{split.catalog} samples. Their is obviously a trade-off between the
integer use here, the time to initialize an existing catalog and
re-starting from zero if everything crash.
Default: \code{split.catalog = 20}. Very useful on a personal computer or
university computer cluster....}

\description{
Run \href{http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/}{STACKS}
\href{http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/comp/cstacks.php}{cstacks}
module inside R! The function runs a summary of the log file automatically
at the end (\code{\link{summary_cstacks}}). In the event of a power outage,
computer or cluster crash, just re-run the function. The function will start
over from the last catalog generated.
}
\details{
\strong{Computer or server problem during the cstacks ?} Look
in the log file to see which individuals remains to be included. Create a
new list of individuals to include and use the catalog.path argument to point
to the catalog created before the problem.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# The simplest form of the function:
run_cstacks()
# that's it ! Now if you have your own workflow folders, etc. See below.
Next example, let say you only want to include 10 individuals/pop and
include in the catalog samples with more than 2000000 reads. With the project
info file in the global environment:
library(tidyverse)
individuals.catalog <- project.info.file) \%>\%
filter(RETAINED > 2000000) \%>\%
group_by(POP_ID) \%>\%
sample_n(size = 10, replace = FALSE) \%>\%
ungroup \%>\%
arrange(desc(RETAINED)) \%>\%
distinct(INDIVIDUALS_REP, POP_ID)
# Write file to disk
readr::write_tsv(x = individuals.catalog,
file = "02_project_info/population.map.catalog.tsv")
# The next line will give you the list of individuals to include
individuals.catalog <- individuals.catalog$INDIVIDUALS_REP

# To keep your info file updated with this information:
project.info.file <- project.info.file \%>\%
mutate(CATALOG = if_else(INDIVIDUALS_REP \%in\% individuals.catalog,
true = "catalog", false = "not_catalog")
)
write_tsv(project.info.file, "project.info.catalog.tsv")

# Then run the command this way:
run_cstacks (
P = "06_ustacks_2_gstacks",
catalog.path = NULL,
n = 1,
parallel.core = 32,
h = FALSE,
max.gaps = 2, min.aln.len = 0.8,
k.len = NULL, report.mmatches = FALSE
)
}
